**Title:** Made a tool to control my IDE from Telegram so I can code from the couch 🛋️

**Body:**

Hey guys, just wanted to share a little tool I threw together this weekend.

It's called **Ricochet**. It basically connects your IDE (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) to Telegram.

I just love going outside for a walk and simply saying "continue work" or explaining a task via voice message from my phone.

**Cool stuff it does:**
*   **Voice Control:** You can send voice notes, and it runs local Whisper to transcribe them into commands for the agent.
*   **Remote Control:** Approve terminal commands, answer questions, or just check status while AFK.
*   **Notifications:** Pings you when a task is done.

It's fully open source. Would love for you guys to try it out and let me know what you think or what features I should add next!
